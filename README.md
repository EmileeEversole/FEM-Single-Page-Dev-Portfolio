## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

### What I learned

I had some stuff come up and, unfortunately, couldn't code for a while. I'm finally able to start getting back in to it! I began working on this project in September, so it sat for a while. Then, while I was working on my website, it kind of got pushed to the side. It took me a little while to get back in the zone and remember what I had done so far, but I think that this was a great project to get myself back in the fold. Creating the functional contact form was somewhat new to me. I've done one for my website, but I used Netlify. This was my first time using Airtable, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!

### Continued development

I had most of the layout complete when I started this project again, but I had to do a decent amount of work on the responsiveness. I still need to find a system that works best for me and doesn't feel too tedious. I'm also hoping to work more with functional aspects of websites and JS as a whole.
